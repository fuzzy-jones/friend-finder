## Description

In this activity, I built a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app displays the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

## Instructions 

The home page of the app has a brief description of the app, and a button "Go To Survey", which will bring the user to the questionnaire form of the app.

The user will then be asked to fill out there name and provide a link to an image of themselves. There are 10 questions to be answered, with all answers being on a 1-5 scale. Once the user hits the submit button at the bottom of the page, the total score of their form will be compared to all the scores of the stored users, and a best match will be displayed.

The footer has a link to display an array of objects with the static users' form data, and a link to the repo of the app.
